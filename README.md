# BetterCUPP
## What is CUPP ?
CUPP stand for Common User Passwords Profiler.

It's an automatic way to create multiple custom passwords from a person's personal information.


## main.py
This python file is where the CUPP program is.
I think it's a better CUPP than the ones already made because there are a lot more possible combinations.


## Why did you do that ?
I made this program so people can see if their password is secure or not.
